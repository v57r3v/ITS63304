Module Learning Outcome   (MLO)
MLO   1:                            Apply   the   appropriate   programming   concepts   and   skills   to   evaluate   and
solve a   given problem.
MLO 2:                               Demonstrate capability to interact positively within a peer group, consider
other viewpoints, and foster stable and   harmonious   relationships in solving   computational problems related to object-oriented programming language.
Problem BackgroundCoastal   cities   face   increasing   threats   from   climate change,   including rising   sea   levels   and   extreme   weather   events.   Sustainable   infrastructure   is   essential   to   mitigate   these   impacts.   Your   task   is   to   develop   a   Climate-Resilient   Building   Evaluation   System   using   Java   language   and   Object-   Oriented   Programming   (OOP)   concepts   to   assess   building   designs   based   on   flood   resilience,   energy efficiency, and   sustainability.
Program Requirements
You are required to write a working Java OOP program that   satisfies the   following requirements:
•         Create a Building   class with the following:
•             name   (String): The   name   of   the   building.
•             height   (double): The height of   the building in meters.
•             floodResilienceScore   (int):   Score (0-10) representing flood resistance, that   measureshow   well   the   building   can   resist   flooding.
•             energyEfficiencyScore   (int):   Score (0-10) for energy efficiency, that measures   how energy-efficient the building is (e.g., based on renewable energy use).
•             sustainabilityScore   (double): A calculated score based on   flood resilience   and   energy efficiency.
•          A   constructor to   initialize the   attributes   (name,   height,   floodResilienceScore,   energyEfficiencyScore).
•   Implement the following methods in the Building   class:
•             calculateSustainabilityScore(): Computes the sustainability score using   the   below   formula:
sustainabilityScore =   (floodResilienceScore +   energyEfficiencySco代 写ITS63304 Object-Oriented Programming 2024Java

•             isFloodResilient(): Returns   true   if floodResilienceScore ≥   7,   otherwise returns   false.
•          printBuildingInfo(): Displays   the   building’s   name,   height,   flood   resilience   score,   energy efficiency score, and   sustainability   score.
•   Main   Program   Requirements:
•             Create an array of   at least five   Building   objects with   different attributes.
•          Use   a loop   to   input   data   for   each   building,   such   as name,   height,   flood resilience   score,   and   energy efficiency   score.
•          After   handling   the   input,   calculate   the   sustainability   score   for   each   building   by   using   the   calculateSustainabilityScore()   method.
•          Display   each   building’s   information   using   printBuildingInfo().
•          Use   selection   statements   (if-else) to   identify and   display   flood-resilient buildings.
•          Use iteration   (loops)   to   determine   and   display   the building with the   highest   sustainability   score.
IMPORTANT: You need to create   a Java   console   application. A   GUI   based   program   will   not be   accepted for this   assignment.
Deliverables:
1.       A   working   /   executable   JAVA   console   program,   that   executes   the   above   requirements.   (Submit the zip files for your project/source code, no need to submit JAR   file).
2.       Prepare   and   submit   a   maximum   5-minute   recorded   video   presentation   explaining   your program   solution. You must be   able to   explain   how   do   you   solve   each   requirements   given   in the question, and points out to   the   code   solution   in   your program.   You   must   also   be   able   to   record   your   program   demonstration   /       run   the   program.   You   must   be   very   clear   and   confident during the presentation.
3.       Prepare   a   report   for the   above program   solution   including the   appropriate description   and   screenshots   of code   and   output.   The report must not   exceed   25 pages.   You MUST   include   the marking rubrics in the report.
